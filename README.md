# Python twisted practice project

Like all my practice projects I setup goals that I try to reach.

## Goals
* ~~Use python twisted~~
* ~~create a SSH server~~
* ~~password auth~~
* ~~Create a Dockerfile and compose~~
* ~~logs all actions of user~~
* should allow the following commands
    *  ~~cat~~
    * ~~wget~~
    * ~~ps~~
    * ~~whoami~~
    * ~~ls~~
* ~~MOTD should be configurable~~
* ~~"user" and "password" should be configurable~~


## Bonus goals
* Fake directory structure to then allow below commands
    * cd
    * ls (better version than above)
* ~~Configuration file to vary honey pot~~

## Puppet
I used masterless puppet to deploy. Just because a current client uses puppet and needed to learn more about it.

## Thanks
